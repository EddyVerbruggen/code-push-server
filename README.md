# AppSync Server [source](https://github.com/EddyVerbruggen/nativescript-app-sync-server) 

## What's this then?
This AppSync server is similar to Microsoft's CodePush server, but tailored for NativeScript apps,
working seamlessly with the [NativeScript AppSync plugin](https://github.com/EddyVerbruggen/nativescript-app-sync).

Huge thanks to [this project](https://github.com/lisong/code-push-server) which this project is based upon.
We didn't fork it because significant (non-unforkeable) changes had to be made (replacing hardcoded Chinese text by English comes to mind).

You can either roll your own clone of this server or use [the shared service we provide](https://appsync-server.nativescript.org/) (which is configured by default by the [NativeScript AppSync plugin](https://github.com/EddyVerbruggen/nativescript-app-sync)).

## Support Storage mode 

- local *storage bundle file in local machine*
- qiniu *storage bundle file in [qiniu](http://www.qiniu.com/)*
- s3 *storage bundle file in [aws](https://aws.amazon.com/)*

heroku logs --app nativescript-codepush-server --tail
```
